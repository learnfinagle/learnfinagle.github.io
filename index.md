Learn how to create real life production microservices with Finagle.

## What are Microservices ?

There's a lot of heap about microservices nowadays but microservices are not
for everyone, so it's better to learn when to use them but and also when
not to use them.

For more about microservices check out these InfoQ presentations:

* [Microservices at Guilt](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/scale-gilt)
* [Microservices at Netflix](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/netflix-ipc)
* [Microservices and Continuous Delivery](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/evolutionary-architecture-microservices-cd)
* More at the [InfoQ Microservices channel](https://www.infoq.com/microservices/presentations/)

## What is Finagle ?

For our journey we are going to use Twitter's Finagle, one of the best
tools to implement microservices. It's based on Scala but also Java can be used.

Finagle is what Twitter uses to keep up with its huge demand and since 2010
it's open source for us to use it at our own projects and apps.

More info about Finagle at:

* [Finagle official website](https://twitter.github.io/finagle/)
* [Finagle at ScalaDays 2011 (video)](http://days2011.scala-lang.org/node/138/286/45.%20Finagle.mp4)
* [Finagle for distributed systems (slides)](https://monkey.org/~marius/talks/twittersystems/#1)

## What is this site about ?

This site will guide you on how to use Finagle to build distributed systems based
on microservices.

We are going to mix Finagle with several other parts of a system like web servers,
load balancers and databases.

All this mixes have their own context to show when to use it, its advantages and
strong points but also its trade-offs and when not to use it.
